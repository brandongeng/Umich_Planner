# Umich Planner

This app is a general purpose planner for Umich students. The app allows for students to view weather using the open weather API, add classes and see how long it takes to get to said class using google maps API and Firebase realtime databases. There is also a todo list maker. Everything can be saved using Google authentication and Firebase.

### TODOS

~~Store API keys safely and have all API calls occur in the backend~~ (8/20/2022 Note: Github ready)<br />
Split into components and put functions in their own js file for easier readability<br />
~~Add clean up function for duration use effect to avoid loops (!!)~~ ~~(8/24/2022 Note: not the issue, login function runs??)~~ (8/27 Solved with pause for loading)

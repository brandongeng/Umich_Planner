# Umich Planner

This app is a general purpose planner for Umich students. The app allows for students to view weather using the open weather API,
add classes and see how long it takes to get to said class using google maps API and Firebase realtime databases. It also allows
for a simple todo list maker. Everything can be saved using Google authentication and Firebase.
